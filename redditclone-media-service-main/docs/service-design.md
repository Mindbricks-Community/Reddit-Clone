It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

- **Service architects** can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
- **Developers and maintainers** will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
- **Stakeholders and reviewers** can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.

> **Note for Frontend Developers**: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the [Service API Documentation](#) for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

> **Note for Backend Developers**: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.

## `Media` Service Settings [**Edit**](media/serviceSettings)

Handles uploading, processing, optimization, scanning, and secure hosting of user-generated media (images, videos, galleries). Performs NSFW and malware detection on all incoming uploads. Manages storage and delivery URLs for association in the content service.

### Service Overview

This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port `3003`,
serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

- **API Test Interface (API Face):** `/`
- **Swagger Documentation:** `/swagger`
- **Postman Collection Download:** `/getPostmanCollection`
- **Health Checks:** `/health` and `/admin/health`
- **Current Session Info:** `/currentuser`
- **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico`

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `redditclone-media-service`.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

- **Preview:** `https://media-api-redditclone.prw.mindbricks.com`
- **Staging:** `https://media-api-redditclone.staging.mindbricks.com`
- **Production:** `https://media-api-redditclone.prod.mindbricks.com`

### Authentication & Security

- **Login Required**: Yes

This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity.
If a crud route also is configured to require login,
it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

### Service Data Objects

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `redditclone-media-service`.

Data deletion is managed using a **soft delete** strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the `isActive` field to `false`.

| Object Name   | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Public Access |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `mediaObject` | Represents a user-uploaded media asset (image, video, gif, document, etc.). Stores metadata, ownership, processing and scan status, storage and delivery URLs. | No            |
| `mediaScan`   | Represents a scan operation performed on a specific mediaObject (e.g., at upload or on-demand re-scan). Records type, results, and details for audit/history.  | No            |

## mediaObject Data Object

### Object Overview

**Description:** Represents a user-uploaded media asset (image, video, gif, document, etc.). Stores metadata, ownership, processing and scan status, storage and delivery URLs.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement.
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration

- **Soft Delete:** Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** No — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on route-level rules.

### Properties Schema

| Property        | Type    | Required | Description                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ownerUserId`   | ID      | Yes      | ID of the user who uploaded/owns this media file.                                    |
| `mediaType`     | Enum    | Yes      | Type of media: image, video, gif, document, audio, unknown.                          |
| `originalUrl`   | String  | Yes      | URL/path to the original uploaded file.                                              |
| `optimizedUrl`  | String  | No       | URL/path to the optimized/processed version (e.g., compressed, transcoded, resized). |
| `previewUrl`    | String  | No       | URL/path to the preview image (thumbnail or short preview for video).                |
| `filename`      | String  | No       | Original filename as uploaded by the user.                                           |
| `fileSize`      | Integer | No       | Size of the uploaded file in bytes.                                                  |
| `status`        | Enum    | Yes      | Processing/state status: 0=pending, 1=ready, 2=failed, 3=quarantined, 4=deleted.     |
| `nsfwScore`     | Float   | No       | Latest NSFW probability/score (0-1); threshold can be used by clients for filtering. |
| `malwareStatus` | Enum    | No       | Malware scan result: 0=unknown, 1=clean, 2=flagged, 3=infected.                      |

- Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.

### Constant Properties

`ownerUserId` `mediaType` `originalUrl` `filename` `fileSize`

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle.
A property is set to be constant if the `Allow Update` option is set to `false`.

### Auto Update Properties

`optimizedUrl` `previewUrl` `status` `nsfwScore` `malwareStatus`

An update crud route created with the option `Auto Params` enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body.
If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the `Allow Auto Update` option to false.
These properties will be added to the update route's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

### Enum Properties

Enum properties are defined with a set of allowed values, ensuring that only valid options can be assigned to them.
The enum options value will be stored as strings in the database,
but when a data object is created an addtional property with the same name plus an idx suffix will be created, which will hold the index of the selected enum option.
You can use the index property to sort by the enum value or when your enum options represent a sequence of values.

- **mediaType**: [image, video, gif, document, audio, other]

- **status**: [pending, ready, failed, quarantined, deleted]

- **malwareStatus**: [unknown, clean, flagged, infected]

### Elastic Search Indexing

`ownerUserId` `mediaType` `originalUrl` `optimizedUrl` `previewUrl` `status` `nsfwScore` `malwareStatus`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API.
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.

### Database Indexing

`ownerUserId` `status`

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval.
Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.

### Relation Properties

`ownerUserId`

Mindbricks supports relations between data objects, allowing you to define how objects are linked together.
You can define relations in the data object properties, which will be used to create foreign key constraints in the database.
For complex joins operations, Mindbricks supportsa BFF pattern, where you can view dynamic and static views based on Elastic Search Indexes.
Use db level relations for simple one-to-one or one-to-many relationships, and use BFF views for complex joins that require multiple data objects to be joined together.

- **ownerUserId**: ID
  Relation to `user`.id

The target object is a sibling object, meaning that the relation is a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship from this object to the target.

On Delete: Set Null
Required: Yes

### Session Data Properties

`ownerUserId`

Session data properties are used to store data that is specific to the user session, allowing for personalized experiences and temporary data storage.
If a property is configured as session data, it will be automatically mapped to the related field in the user session during CRUD operations.
Note that session data properties can not be mutated by the user, but only by the system.

- **ownerUserId**: ID property will be mapped to the session parameter `userId`.

This property is also used to store the owner of the session data, allowing for ownership checks and access control.

### Filter Properties

`ownerUserId` `mediaType` `status`

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria.
These properties are automatically mapped as route parameters in the listing CRUD routes that have "Auto Params" enabled.

- **ownerUserId**: ID has a filter named `ownerUserId`

- **mediaType**: Enum has a filter named `mediaType`

- **status**: Enum has a filter named `status`

## mediaScan Data Object

### Object Overview

**Description:** Represents a scan operation performed on a specific mediaObject (e.g., at upload or on-demand re-scan). Records type, results, and details for audit/history.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement.
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

- `4`: Layer 5 - Finalization and Aggregation

### Hook Function Signatures

#### After Where Clause Hook

```javascript
async function afterWhereClauseHook(context, whereClause) {
  // Modify or validate the where clause
  // Return modified whereClause or throw error
  return whereClause;
}
```

#### Before DB Command Hook

```javascript
async function beforeDbCommandHook(context, dbCommand) {
  // Intercept before database operation
  // Return modified command or custom response
  return dbCommand;
}
```

#### After DB Command Hook

```javascript
async function afterDbCommandHook(context, result) {
  // Process database operation result
  // Return modified result or throw error
  return result;
}
```

### Edge Function Signature

```javascript
async function edgeFunction(request) {
  // Custom request processing
  // Return response object or throw error
  return {
    data: {},
    status: 200,
    message: "Success",
  };
}
```
